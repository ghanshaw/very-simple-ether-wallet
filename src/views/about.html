<h1>About</h1>

<p> 
    This is a simple wallet created to demonstrate the basics of working with the Ethereum blockchain.
    The wallet allows users to move funds between the account attached to the contract, and three demo
    accounts. I built this project in Solidity, using the Truffle framework.
